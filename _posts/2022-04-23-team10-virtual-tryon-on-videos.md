> Image-based Virtual Try-On focuses on transferring a desired clothing item on to a person's image seamlessly without using 3D information of any form. A key objective of Virtual Try-On models is to align the in-shop garment with the corresponding body parts in the person image. The problem at hand becomes challenging due to the spatial misalignment between the garment and the person's image. With the recent advances of deep learning and Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs), intensive studies were done to accomplish this task and were able to achieve moderately succesful results. The subsequent task in this direction would be is to apply the Virtual Try-On on videos. This has many applications in fashion, e-commerce etc sectors. A fundamental barrier to overcome while working with videos is temporal coherency. We aim to propose method to apply Virtual Try-On on Videos by smoothly addressing the temporal dimesion and hence resulting in a seamless output as compared to some of the current methods.

## Motivation
With the rise of online shopping and e-retail platforms, Virtual Try-On of clothing garments is a key feature to enhance the experience of the online shoppers. Many intensive studies are done to solve this problem. Some initial methods focussed on image to image translation models without spatial aligment. Later some studies addressed the spatial alignment by performing garment warping using local appearance flow. One of latest studies also proposed a global appearance flow using StyleGANs for better spatial adjustment. So overall, a lot of work has been done in the are of image based Virtual Try-On and results have suprassed the minimum satisfiable requirements. While there are still room for improvement in image based Virtual Try-On methods, generating videos with Virtual Try-On is also very relevant in e-commerce and should be addressed hand in hand with image based approaches. Most existing video-based virtual try-on methods usually require clothing templates and they can only generate blurred and low-resolution results. Very few methods exist which uses relatively new versions of GAN to solve the video-based virtual try-on problem. Hence in this project, we would like to address this problem by taking a closer look of existing approaches and solving the problems with them.
