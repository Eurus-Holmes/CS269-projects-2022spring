> Character design is a challenging process: artists need to design a generally new

## Motivation
To create a new and unique character for games, anime, etc. it takes years of the art training to master drawing skills and digital art software for virtualizing the design ideas. Even acquiring these skills, the process of designing a character takes days, even months, to refine and finalize the design. If we can utilize automation, we can ease the creation process. For example, some research uses neural network based model to do automatic coloring for sketches or line art. If we provide a segmentation map, some models can generate the illustration. Models like GAN can generate characters' pictures to have a starting point for designing a character or even characters that can be directly put into practice.

The challenge is when people are trying to design a new character for new work, it is a new concept of art. There are only few data to reference. We are wondering if we can still utilize automation to help with the character design. For example, Pokemon series tends to have a unified color for a Pokemon due to the type system. Also, the line art of Pokemon is cleaner compared to Digimon. To design a new Pokemon, there are only 905 existed Pokemon for us to train. However, the design of the characters for both works is based on humans, animals, plants, or items. We want to investigate if we can distill knowledge from all similar designs and apply them to new concept arts.

## Method

### Line Art Recognition


### Image Generation

Due to the success of StyleGAN [2] and StyleGAN2 [3] on photo and anime-style art generation, we are going to focus on the extension and analysis of StyleGAN in this process. In this section we will introduce what is StyleGAN, StyleGAN2 and the direction discovery can be performed on StyleGAN.

### Colorization


## Goals
1. Collect and clean up pokemon data (add in data of eighth generation yet). Add in line art, part segmentation mask and pokemon metadata labels. 
2. Train StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 on cleaned Pokemon data. Add the line art/segemntation/pokemon metadata prediction discriminator branches to it.
3. Compare the latent space changes before and after adding the above branches. See if disentanglement along these dimensions happen. 
4. Possible Extension: see if we can allow human input to control line art and drawing as separate steps.

| :---                    | :---        |    :----:   | 
| Veekun Sprites 256x256  | 819         | [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset)|
| Images without label    | 7357        | [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/djilax/pkmn-image-dataset)       |
| Official Art mix sizes  | 833         | [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daemonspade/pokemon-images)|

## Current Progress
### Data Preprocessing
We are working on combining the images from different dataset. We have to unify the size of the image and the format of the image among different datasets. 


### Sketch
We have successfully run HED [1] to extract line art from the Pokemon image.

### StyleGAN
We have succesfully trained StyleGAN on pokemon sprites (256x256 images) and get some preliminary results. Some sample generated images are shown in the figure below:
