## Motivation
To create a character for games, anime, etc. it takes years of training to acquire drawing skills and master digital art software for virtualizing the design ideas. Furthermore, the process of designing a character takes days, even months, to draw and refine the design. If we utilize automation, we could ease the creation process. For example, we can use neural network based model to help coloring sketch or line art. We can also use GAN to generate characters pictures to have a starting point for designing a character.
(Something related to few data)
Since the design of the character is based on human, animals, or items, there are lots of models are trained on these data. We are wondering if we are able to do domain transfer on these models for character design. (Ending)


## Goals
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Datasets


## Related Work





## Current Progress

### Data Preprocessing
We are working on combining the images from different dataset. Therefore, we have to unify the size of the image and the format of the image. 


### Line Art of Image
We have successfully run HED to extract line art from the Pokemon image.



## StyleGAN
