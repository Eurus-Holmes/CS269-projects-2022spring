## Background

Nowadays reinforcement learning(RL) has extensive applications in the field of autonomous driving. To build RL sgents for autonomous driving, we usually perform training in simulators, as training in real-world settings can be expensive and impractical. This brings challenges for current simulation platforms: It need to capture the complexity and diveristy of real-world situations. Otherwise, RL agents trained in simulators may fail to generalize to unseen driving scenarios. 

To address the generalization problem of RL algorithms in autonomous driving, some researchers proposed MetaDrive<sup>[1]</sup>, a simulation platform including a wide range of driving scenarios with various road networks and traffic flows. Compositionality is the key feature of MetaDrive. A driving scenario is composed by map, traffic flow, obstacles, and target vehicles. The map is further composed by a set of road blocks, which can be generated by procedural generation or imported from real-world data. The traffic flow contains a set of traffic vehicles responsive to the actions of target vehicles. The obstacles are randomly placed in scenarios, and collisions with obstacles could yield cost in RL training.

MetaDrive largely facilitates the generalization of  RL in autonomous driving. On the basis of its compositionality and flexibility, we hope to add interactivity as a new feature. Our goal is to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of RL training by including human in the loop.  In our implementation, human could configure and adjust the driving scenarios in MetaDrive, thus increasing the complexity of driving scenarios and enhancing the performance of RL agents.

## Motivation

Human interaction will help the training of reinforcement learning and autonomous driving from many aspects: On the one hand, human could provide necessary guidance to RL agents in training. On the other hand, human involvement could augment the complexity of driving scenarios, so that it could further improve the generalization of RL agents. Including human in the loop also makes the scenarios closer to the situations in real-world applications, where human collaborate with machine in driving tasks.
